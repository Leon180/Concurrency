# 📈 Golang High Concurrency Roadmap

Welcome to the Golang High Concurrency Learning Project!

This repository is designed to help backend developers like you master the art of building high-performance, highly concurrent systems using Go. It's structured as a step-by-step learning path — with side-projects, patterns, and performance tools to sharpen your skills.

---

## 📌 Roadmap Overview

### 🥋 Phase 1: Concurrency Basics
- [ ] goroutine + channel practice
- [ ] context cancellation + timeout
- [ ] sync primitives (WaitGroup, Mutex, sync.Map)
- [ ] Simple concurrent crawler
- [ ] pprof basics

### ⚔️ Phase 2: Concurrency Control & Patterns
- [ ] Token Bucket Rate Limiter
- [ ] Retry with Backoff
- [ ] Worker Pool implementation
- [ ] Task Queue system
- [ ] Benchmarking & profiling

### 🧠 Phase 3: Real-World Architecture
- [ ] High-concurrency Chat System
- [ ] API Gateway with Rate Limit + Auth
- [ ] Redis Caching Layer
- [ ] Kafka-based Async Processing
- [ ] Docker Compose deployment
- [ ] Tracing with Jaeger
- [ ] Observability (Prometheus + Grafana)

## 🧪 Performance Tools

- `pprof`: analyze CPU/memory usage
- `k6`: load testing
- `wrk`: HTTP benchmarking
- `Prometheus + Grafana`: metrics
- `Jaeger`: distributed tracing

---

## 📘 Learning Goals

- Understand Go concurrency primitives
- Design scalable, high-throughput systems
- Analyze performance bottlenecks
- Build production-grade microservices
